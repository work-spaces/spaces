# spaces

`spaces` is a poly-repo workflow and task-runner tool. It is powered by `starlark` and `rust`.

## Using spaces

`spaces` executes `starlark` scripts in two phases:

- Checkout: (effiently) collects everything from source code to tools into a local workspace folder
- Run: execute user-defined rules to build, test, run or deploy your project

### Checkout phase

`spaces` creates folder populated with everything you need for your project.

- `sysroot`: hardlinks to everything you normally put in `/usr/local`
- `tools`: repos used for pulling in sysroot tools
- `libs`: repos where you want to see the source but not modify the source
- `env`: source this file to access tools in the sysroot (and limit access to other paths)
- `spaces_logs`: folder for spaces to log the steps it takes
- `spaces.star`: starlark file generated by `spaces` containing run rules and lock info
- `README.md`: this is a user-defined file that `spaces` generates so that users know what to do
-  sources: various source code repositories that you want to modify

### Run phase

The run rules execute tasks in order and as needed. Run rules have:

- `name`: the way to refer to this task when adding dependencies to other tasks
- an action: typically launch a process but there are a few others
- `deps`: explicit dependencies that must run before this task
- `inputs`/`outputs`: when inputs of one task match outputs of another task a dependency is created implicitly

Specified inputs are hashed. If the inputs haven't changed, the rule is skipped. If no `inputs` are specified, the rule always runs.




For example:

```star
checkout.add_repo(
    name = "spaces",
    git = "https://github.com/work-spaces/spaces",
    branch = "main",
    checkout = "BranchHead",
)
```

When running `spaces checkout`, the `spaces` repo will be cloned as a bare repository in the spaces store (`$HOME/.spaces/store`) and add a worktree to the workspace. `spaces` will check the repository for a `spaces.star` starlark script and run the checkout phase to ensure transitive dependencies are added.

```star
checkout.add_platform_archive(
    name = "rustup-init",
    platforms = { 
        "macos_aarch64": {
            "url": "https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/aarch64-apple-darwin/rustup-init",
            "sha256": "f547d77c32d50d82b8228899b936bf2b3c72ce0a70fb3b364e7fba8891eba781",
            "add_prefix": "sysroot/bin",
            "link": "Hard"
        },
        "macos_x86_64": {
            "url": "https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-apple-darwin/rustup-init",
            "sha256": "f547d77c32d50d82b8228899b936bf2b3c72ce0a70fb3b364e7fba8891eba781",
            "add_prefix": "sysroot/bin",
            "link": "Hard"
        }
    }
)
```

The script above will download and extract the `rustup-init` binary to the spaces store if it doesn't already exist. It will hardlink the `rustup-init` binary in the workspace at `sysroot/bin/rustup-init`.

### Checkout Rules


```star


```

## Cargo Example

This example creates a workspace that allows you to develop `spaces` right next to `printer-rs`. `printer-rs` provides the `spaces` printer and is commonly developed alongside `spaces`.

Consider the file `config/develop_spaces.toml`:

```toml
[settings]
branch = "{SPACE}-{UNIQUE}"

[vscode.extensions]
recommendations = ["rust-lang.rust-analyzer"]

[vscode.settings]
"editor.formatOnSave" = true

[repositories]
spaces = { git = "https://github.com/tyler-gilbert/spaces", branch = "development" }
printer = { git = "https://github.com/tyler-gilbert/printer-rs", branch = "development" }

[cargo.patches]
spaces = ["printer"]

[cargo.build]
rustc-wrapper = "sccache"
```

I can run:

```sh
spaces create --name=spaces-dev --config=config/develop_spaces.toml
```

This will create:

- spaces-dev
  - .vscode
    - extensions.json
    - settings.json
    - tasks.json (coming soon)
  - .config/cargo.toml
  - spaces
  - printer-rs

## Contributing

Install the latest version to `spaces`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/work-spaces/workflows
spaces create --name=spaces-my-issue --config=workflows=spaces_develop.toml
```

Open the `spaces-my-issue` folder in VSCode (or your editor of choice) and start editing.

When you are ready, create a PR and request to merge to the `development` branch.
